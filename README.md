Math 307 Report: Relations represented with 3 data structures. 
NOTE: This project required JGraphT library in order to render graphs!
      download it at https://jgrapht.org
     
 if you are unable to install the JGraphT library, the following relation demonstrations can still be used 
 without rendering. Simply indicate no to the render graph option if using the terminal input method of setup, 
 or set the rendergraph variable to false if implementing them another way.
